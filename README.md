# ICS4U1-Culminating-VisualNovel

This was a culminating ***IDEA*** for ICS4U1.

It was vetoed under concerns that the program would not be complex enough for a 4U level project.

The actual project that was submitted can be found [here.](https://github.com/protoconal/ICS4U1-Culminating-Dungeon)

***We could have written a whole romance visual novel but ok.***

***Expanded the game using mini-games that actually used arrays, sorts and 4U-level concepts.***

***Anyways, a mark is a mark***
